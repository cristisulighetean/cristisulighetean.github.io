Hi, I'm Cristian, an embedded programmer with over two years of experience who has recently ventured into the exciting world of DevOps. I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and expanding my skill set, which led me to make the shift to DevOps. I appreciate the flexibility and diverse opportunities that the field offers, including the ability to work remotely or in hybrid environments.

Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree and working on the final thesis project which is focused on an Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring system for home offices. At the same time, I am learning and experimenting a lot in regard with DevOps.
