Hi, I'm Cristian, and I have a background in embedded programming with a couple of years of experience. Recently, I've decided to transition into the world of DevOps, and it's been an enjoyable journey so far. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and expand my expertise, and DevOps offers a great platform for that. It also provides flexibility and diverse opportunities, such as remote and hybrid work options.

Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree and focusing on a thesis project about Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring systems for home offices. When I'm not occupied with DevOps or my studies, I find pleasure in working on embedded systems, DIY projects, and other fascinating hobbies.
