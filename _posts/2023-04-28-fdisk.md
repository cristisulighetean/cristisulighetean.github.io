A guide to working with fdisk

 `fdisk`  is a powerful command-line utility for managing disk partitions on Linux systems. It allows you to create, delete, resize, and manipulate partitions on your storage devices. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of working with  `fdisk`  and cover the various features and options it provides.

## Preparing to Use fdisk

Before we start working with  `fdisk` , ensure that you have root privileges, as the utility requires administrative access to manage disk partitions. You can switch to the root user or use  `sudo`  to execute  `fdisk`  commands.

## Listing Disk Partitions

To list the available storage devices and their partitions, run the  `fdisk -l`  command:

```sh
sudo fdisk -l
```

This command will display information about all detected storage devices and their partition tables.

## Starting fdisk

To start working with  `fdisk` , you need to specify the target storage device. For example, to manage the partitions on the  `/dev/sda`  device, run the following command:

```sh
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

This will open the  `fdisk`  utility in interactive mode, allowing you to perform various operations on the specified device.

## Navigating fdisk

While in interactive mode, you can use the following commands to navigate and manage disk partitions:

- `m` : Displays the help menu, showing a list of available commands.
- `p` : Prints the current partition table of the selected device.
- `n` : Creates a new partition on the device.
- `d` : Deletes an existing partition.
- `t` : Changes the partition type.
- `w` : Writes the changes to the disk and exits  `fdisk` .
- `q` : Quits  `fdisk`  without saving any changes.

## Creating a New Partition

To create a new partition, follow these steps:

1. Enter the  `n`  command to create a new partition.
2. Choose the partition type: primary ( `p` ) or extended ( `e` ). Primary partitions can host filesystems, while extended partitions can host multiple logical partitions.
3. Specify the partition number. If you're creating a primary partition, the number must be between 1 and 4. For extended partitions, you can create multiple logical partitions within the extended partition.
4. Set the starting sector for the partition. You can accept the default value or specify a custom starting sector.
5. Define the partition size by specifying the last sector or the partition size using the  `+`  notation (e.g.,  `+5G`  for a 5 GB partition).
6. Once you're satisfied with the partition configuration, use the  `w`  command to write the changes to the disk.

## Deleting a Partition

To delete a partition, follow these steps:

1. Enter the  `d`  command to delete a partition.
2. Specify the partition number you want to delete.
3. Confirm your choice by pressing  `Enter` .
4. Use the  `w`  command to write the changes to the disk.

## Changing a Partition Type

To change the partition type, follow these steps:

1. Enter the  `t`  command to change the partition type.
2. Specify the partition number you want to modify.
3. Enter the new partition type's hexadecimal code (e.g.,  `83`  for Linux,  `82`  for swap). You can view a list of supported partition types by typing  `L` .
4. Use the  `w`  command to write the changes to the disk.

## Resizing a Partition

 `fdisk`  does not natively support resizing partitions. However, you can achieve this by deleting the existing partition and creating a new one with the desired size, without writing the changes to the disk in between these operations. Note that this method is risky and may result in data loss, so ensure you have a backup before proceeding.

To resize a partition, follow these steps:

1. Use the  `p`  command to print the current partition table.
2. Note down the starting sector of the partition you want to resize.
3. Enter the  `d`  command to delete the partition.
4. Specify the partition number you want to delete.
5. Create a new partition using the  `n`  command, as described in the "Creating a New Partition" section.
6. Use the starting sector you noted down in step 2 for the new partition.
7. Define the new partition size by specifying the last sector or the partition size using the  `+`  notation (e.g.,  `+10G`  for a 10 GB partition).
8. Use the  `w`  command to write the changes to the disk.

After resizing the partition, you may need to resize the filesystem as well, using utilities like  `resize2fs`  for ext4 or  `xfs_growfs`  for XFS.

## Final Thoughts

`fdisk`  is a versatile and powerful tool for managing disk partitions on Linux systems. With the commands and examples provided in this guide, you can efficiently create, delete, and manipulate partitions on your storage devices.

However, keep in mind that working with  `fdisk`  can be risky, as it directly modifies the partition table. Always backup your data before making changes to your disk partitions, and exercise caution while using  `fdisk`  to avoid data loss or system corruption.
